Hi! I'm Pedro. Welcome to my personal webpage.

I have decided to create this page for some reasons. The first reason (an important one) is to learn english, particularly written english. The second one is to create the habit of write technical posts about software engineering, IT, computer science, artifical intelligence and so on. And the last (but not least) reason is to create some kind of portfolio of my infinite-long list of unfinished projects. 

In order to start on the right foot, let me introduce myself a little bit. As I said, my name is Pedro and from Spain. In my spare time I like to read both computer science and novels. I'm a huge fun of fantasy books and mystery thillers (crime and terror especially). I also like videogames (ofc :D), but adult life doesn't let me play as much as I would like. The other things I do on a daily basis is to walk my dog and CrossFit.

I know this things are so common, but I'm just a normal person :D

If you have reached out this, I welcome you to my personal webpage :D

By the way, this is my dog:
