- **Dec 2024 - Present | Idoven**  
  Dec 2024 - Present | Product Software Engineer Backend (Full-time)

- **Oct 2018 - Dec 2024 | Cambrian Intelligence SL**  
  Jul 2019 - Dec 2024 | Software Engineer & Machine Learning Engineer (Full-time)  
    - Design and implementation of a machine translation system deployed in AWS leveraging services like **API Gateway, Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront**.
    - API Rest development to expose complex deep learning-based systems and web services using **Go** and **Python (Flask)**.
    - Full-stack design and implementation of a tool to retrieve atmospheric data from several public sources and expand datasets with this information. Developed a **REST API (FastAPI)** to expose the service for seamless access and integration.
    - Development of full **Machine Learning pipelines** for a variety of data sources, from data exploration to model productionization.
    - Full-stack design and implementation of a Machine Learning-based early warning system to anticipate exacerbation in patients with COPD. Use technologies such as **TensorFlow, Flask, Celery, and Docker**. The system is actively used by a medical team to enhance treatment of about 120 patients with COPD.
    - **C++ DLL** to deploy deep learning models in environments without internet access and under Windows systems. This DLL is currently used in production by tuna fishing ships for a variety of tasks.
    - Pipeline for **3D data generation** using **Unreal Engine**. This generated 3D data is used to train deep learning models for solving object detection and counting tasks. This model has been deployed and is currently being used.
    - **RAG** framework utilizing **Chroma DB** for efficient document embedding. It enables query-based retrieval, semantic search, and contextual document validation.

  Oct 2018 - Jul 2019 | Junior Machine Learning Developer (Full-time)
  - Data preparation, data visualization and ML modeling using healthcare data.
  - API development using **Flask**.

- **Jun 2018 - Oct 2018 | Sopra Steria**  
  QA Tester (intern)
